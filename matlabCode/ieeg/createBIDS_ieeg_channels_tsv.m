%% make a participants table and save

%% required columns
name = {''}; % Label of the channel, only contains letters and numbers. The label must
% correspond to _electrodes.tsv name and all ieeg type channels are required to have \
% a position. The reference channel name MUST be provided in the reference column

type = {''}; % Type of channel, see below for adequate keywords in this field

units = {''}; % Physical unit of the value represented in this channel, e.g., V for Volt,
% specified according to the SI unit symbol and possibly prefix symbol (e.g., mV, ?V),
% see the BIDS spec (section 15 Appendix V: Units) for guidelines for Units and Prefixes.

low_cutoff = [0]; % Frequencies used for the low pass filter applied to the
% channel in Hz. If no low pass filter was applied, use n/a. Note that
% anti-alias is a low pass filter, specify its frequencies here if applicable.

high_cutoff = [0]; % Frequencies used for the high pass filter applied to
% the channel in Hz. If no high pass filter applied, use n/a.

%% recommended columns:

reference = {''}; % Specification of the reference (e.g., "mastoid", "ElectrodeName01",
% "intracranial", "CAR", "other", "n/a"). If the channel is not an electrode channel
% (e.g., a microphone channel) use `n/a`.

group = {''}; % Which group of channels (grid/strip/probe) this channel belongs to.
% One group has one wire and noise can be shared. This can be a name or number.
% Note that any groups specified in `_electrodes.tsv` must match those present here.

%% optional  columns

sampling_frequency = [0]; % Sampling rate of the channel in Hz.

description = {''}; % Brief free-text description of the channel, or other information of
% interest (e.g. position (e.g., 'left lateral temporal surface', 'unipolar/bipolar', etc.)).

notch = [0]; % Frequencies used for the notch filter applied to the channel,
% in Hz. If no notch filter applied, use n/a.

status = {''}; % Data quality observed on the channel (good/bad). A channel is considered bad
% if its data quality is compromised by excessive noise. Description of noise type SHOULD be
% provided in [status_description].

status_description = {''}; % Freeform text description of noise or artifact affecting data
% quality on the channel. It is meant to explain why the channel was declared bad in [status].
