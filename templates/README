### Introduction
The README is usually the starting point for researchers using your data
and serves as a guidepost for users of your data. A clear and informative
README makes your data much more usable.

**Overview:** 
* A paragraph giving an overview of the experiment. This should include the 
goals or purpose and a discussion about how the experiment tries to achieve
these goals.

* A brief overview of the tasks in the experiment.

* A brief discussion of condition variables (sometimes called contrasts
or independent variables) that were varied across the experiment.

* A brief discussion of the response variables (sometimes called the
dependent variables) that were measured and or calculated to assess
the effects of varying the condition variables. This might also include
questionnaires administered to assess behavioral aspects of the experiment.

* A brief discussion of the control variables --- that is what aspects 
were explicitly controlled in this experiment. The control variables might 
include subject pool, environmental conditions, set up, or other things 
that were explicitly controlled.

More details on all of this should be included in the Methods section.


### Methods   

**Subjects:** A brief sentence about the subject pool in this experiment.
 
**Apparatus:**  A summary of the equipment and environment setup for the
experiment. For example, was the experiment performed in a shielded room
with the subject seated in a fixed position.

**Initial setup:** A summary of what setup was performed when a subject arrived.

**Task organization:** How the tasks were organized for a session.
This is particularly important because BIDS datasets usually have task data
separrated into different files.)
What was the order that tasks were performed? 
Was task order counter-balanced?  
What other activities were interspersed because the tasks?  

**Task details:**  As much detail as possible about the task and the
events that were recorded.
