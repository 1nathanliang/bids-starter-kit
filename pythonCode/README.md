# Using BIDS with Python

The BIDS format has several tools in the Python ecosystem. These are broadly
split into two groups: one for converting and storing data in the BIDS format,
and another for analyzing and manipulating pre-existing BIDS datasets.

## Converting your data to BIDS

-   [mne-bids](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-bids) is a collection of tools
    for converting magnetoencephalography (MEG) data into BIDS format, as well
    as some helper functions for creating the folders and metadata needed for a
    BIDS dataset. Check out their
    [online documentation](http://mne-tools.github.io/mne-bids/) and the
    [examples gallery](https://mne-tools.github.io/mne-bids/auto_examples/index.html)
    to learn how to use this package.
-   In addition, this repository contains some helper scripts to facilitate
    creating your BIDS dataset. See the `.py` files in this folder for the most
    up-to-date set of scripts.

## Analyzing your BIDS datasets

-   [pybids](https://github.com/INCF/pybids) is a tool for quickly parsing /
    searching the components of a BIDS dataset. It also contains functionality
    for running analyses on your data.
